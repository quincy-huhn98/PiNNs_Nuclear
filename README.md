# PiNNs_Nuclear
Physics Informed Neural Networks for Nuclear Multiphysics Simulations

# Description
The current project contains two PiNNs aimed at solving problems in nuclear engineering.
These two PiNNs are for the incompressible Navier Stokes equations with buoyancy and a general advection-diffusion-reaction equation.
